# Pursuer_evader_game
This repository contains the Python code for a differential game of two robots which uses Machine Learning techniques to override the use of Model Predictive Control(MPC),which makes this strategy of capturing efficient in real-time. 
Two ipynb files are added contains two diffrent cases 1) fixed point case 2) varing position of the evader
